# Software must meet the following requirements:
## Business requirements:
* The software must operate as a payroll system, and track employee payment information.  Users are categorized as employee users, department head users, or admin users, and reports can be generated by employees, department heads, and admin users.  
* To meet project constraints, a deliverable product must be available by October 2019. Additionally, the total project cost must be less than $36,000.
* The system will be used in the U.S., and must adhere to all regulations pertaining to payroll generating systems in the United States. Furthermore, the system will utilize English as its language.

## User requirements

* The system will differentiate between three types of users on login, each with different access privileges.  Only accounting department employees will be given admin privileges.
* Regular employee users can login to the system and view information about their current biweekly pay period and stored personal information.  They cannot view any other records for any other employee.  Personal information includes name, address, salary, position, tax rate, and medical costs.
* Department head users have the access privileges of regular employee users.  Additionally, they can generate reports for their department as a whole, which list total departmental pay, total taxes, total medical deductions, and a list of each individual employee's name and individual pay.  
* Department head users can also request payment reports on individual employees within their department, but cannot view the personal information of other employees. To access this information, department heads can search for employees within their department by name or employee ID number.
* Admin users have the access privileges of department head users. However, they can generate full reports on any individual employee in the company, including personal information.  To access this information, they can search for any employee in the company using name or employee ID number.
* Admin users can also generate company-wide reports, which track department totals and the company total of employee pay, taxes, benefit deductions. Benefit deductions include (but are not limited to) medical insurance, dental coverage, retirement plans, and stocks.

## Functional
* The system must pull information from a previously established database to generate payroll reports.  Database information includes all pertinent information about employees.
* Using database information, the system must calculate projected gross income, state tax, federal tax, benefit deductions, and net income, for a bi-weekly pay period.  Benefit deductions are the same as previously defined.
* The system must have a search function that operates based upon the current user's privileges.  If the user is a standard employee, it should not be visible.  If the user is a department head, it should limit search results to those within that user's department.  If the user is an admin, search results should be company-wide.

## Implementation requirements:

* The system uses previously established databases of employee information to generate records.  Any changes to the database or the payroll system are stored in the database.

## Should list
The requirements below should be implemented but are not vital to the first version of our software. These requirements have to do with users adding and editing data in the database, and thus in the payroll system. These are requirements that we aim to implement in the future to add functionality to our software but don't hinder the basic functionality of our software.
* Admin users can edit/add employees' data. Such as personal information like name, payroll ID, position, date of payment, taxes and gross pay. (User)
* change status for those who quit or retire from the company. (User)
* Passwords for admin should change on a regular basis. (Functional)
* Users can input employee information directly into the system manually. (User)
* Admin can suspend employees. (User)
* Suspended employees are removed from payroll system. (Functional)
* Any information changed by admin users will edit the information stored in the remote databases. (Functional)

# Could list
These requirements are not necessary in the first release. However, based off of the company's situation, e.g. having international employees, needs for handling actual payments as well as just generating payroll, or advanced searching systems, these features could be added to the system in the later releases.   

* User can request payment in check or direct deposit (User).  
* Admin users can specify which payment methods employees receive (User).
* Reports will generate as previously specified, but will also include the preferred payment method for each employee (functional).
* The system will appropriately handle different employee residence information, such as U.S. citizens, J1 Visa holders, H1 Visa holders, and others. (Functional)
* Search systems will include correction and attempt to find matches for misspelled entries. (Functional)

# Won't list
The system will be accessed from the command line, so there is no need to implement a Graphical User Interface. Likewise, the company is not interested in supporting hourly workers.
* The system won't have a GUI. (User)
* The system won't support moving and clicking the computer mouse. (User)
* The system won't display html pages. (User)
* The system won't include html instructions or video instructions. (User)
* The system won't support employees paid hourly. (Functional)
* The system won't enable hourly workers to clock in and clock out. (Functional).
* The system won't calculate the payment for employees by clocked hours. (Functional)
* The system won't calculate overtime pay. (Functional)
* The system won't allow employees to change their scheduled work hours. (Functional)
